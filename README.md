# hello-world
First Repository for Practice and Test Projects

"Hello World" or whatever (extremely) small percentenge that will actually read this...  My name is Ryan and I'm a musician that needed to find something that pays the bills a bit better than a bachelors in music has so far.  Teaching myself all this junk and, therefore, will have some pretty sketchy stuff in my early works.  Hoping to use this resource, among others, to keep me on the right track and keep bad habits to a minimum.  Obviously, some habits are subjectively bad and, as JB would say, "just a matter of opinion", but that opinion is what I'd like to hear.

Anyway, thanks for checking this out and I look forward to a bright future in front of bright screens.
